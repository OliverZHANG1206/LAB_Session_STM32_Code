# LAB_Session_STM32_Code
## STM32 Progamming in Lab Session in UNNC
### This is only for private backups and not for any other purposes.
Containning 7 packages:
 1. Demo: LED BLINK
 2. Demo:  USART2 communication between computer and STM32
 3. Demo: Stop watch design using STM32
 4. Demo(advance): Stop watch with LCD display
 5. Demo: ADC sampling using STM32

Olther Two are final implementation with radar HB100
 1. ADC sampling + FFT -> doppler frequency
 2. Comparator -> doppler frequency
